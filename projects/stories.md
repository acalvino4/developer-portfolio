Stories is a landing page for a fictional upcoming travel journal app. On the contact page when a user enters her contact information, it is saved into the appâ€™s database.

This project was an exercise in developing a basic static site using Ruby on Rails. It uses the Active Record ORM to create records in the database.

To build this app, I used:

* HTML and CSS for the front end
* Rails for the back end
* Heroku to deploy the app
* Bootstrap for ease of styling
