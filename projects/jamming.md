This project is a web app I built to strengthen my knowledge of React. It uses class-based components, and interfaces with the spotify API to search for music and create playlists with the search results. It also made me aware of free easy-to-use static hosting services like [surge](https://surge.sh) and gave me experience deploying to it.
