This project was an exercise in devoping a basic static site using Ruby on Rails. The extent to which this is a portfolio is only in that it includes screenshots of some other rails projects I coded while working up to this one. The site you are on now is my actual portfolio, so for the most part links on this rails portfolio just link back here. I used some bootstrap classes for ease of styling. I used the Active Record ORM to generate portfolio item cards from database records.

This was also my first time using a serverless platform (heroku), which was necessary (as opposed to a site like surge that hosts only static assets) since rails is a server-side rendered framework.

To build this app, I used:

* HTML and CSS for the front end
* Rails for the back end
* Heroku to deploy the app
* Bootstrap for ease of styling
