This project was where I first built a place to present my personal development work. Hosted on github pages, it is a static site based on a template from [html5up](https://html5up.net). Besides changing the content in the template, I implemented a search bar, tweaked the responsiveness and style of the page, and modified the structure of the project cards.

### Takeaways
My biggest takeaway was learning how to make sense of someone else's code and modify it. (I started out feeling intimidated to modify anything other than HTML, but by the end was modifying the scss, color palette, and even javascript with ease.) I gained a lot of proficiency with Chrome DevTools, which was extremely helpful in locating elements, styles, and javascript that I wanted to modify. I performed the process of modifying and compiling sass to css for the first time. It also was my first time publicly hosting a website.
