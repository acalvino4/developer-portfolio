This project uses the old AngularJS framework to help find places of interest (as determined by having a wikipedia entry) in your vicinity.

It uses the third-party leaflet directive for maps, and the Wikipedia geodata API to find places of interst.

Project began with a tutorial, to which I added
* auto-center on your location (if you give your browser permission)
* auto-search whenever map is moved (seem to have stopped working sometimes, probably due to old libraries)
* an enhanced welcome page
* separate welcome and about pages
