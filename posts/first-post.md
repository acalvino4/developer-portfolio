# This is my first ever blog post!

As I start to progress in my career, I (like many developers before me) need a place to record my discoveries so as to recall them quickly when the need arises. Also like many other tech bloggers before me, I hope that this blog will be helpful for others who find themselves trying to solve some of the issues I have worked through. In doing so, I hope for this to be the beginning of my giving back to the online developer community.
